    <string name="tutorial_01">First let\'s look at the different screen elements.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_07">Your objective is to get your card score down to FIVE points or fewer. Joker=0; Ace=1; J,Q,K=10; other cards=face value. E.g. Your hand is worth 39 points, your opponent has 28.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_08">You can drop multiple cards at the same time if they are the same kind or a straight of three cards or more of the same suit. You can use a Joker to replace a missing card in a straight.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_09">In this case your highest cards are the 2 Jacks. You can swap them for a visible pile card or an unknown card from the deck.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_10">The 7 on the pile isn\'t useful here: you don\'t have any 7\'s with which to make a pair next go and it doesn\'t help you make a straight.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_11">Please click on both Jacks and then click on the deck to pick up a card from there.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_13">It\'s now the computer\'s turn. The Jacks you just dropped aren\'t useful to him so he\'ll drop the two Kings and also pick up from the deck.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_15">You could keep your 8♥ and 10♥ hoping to get a 9♥ or a Joker but that seems a remote possibility. Let\'s drop the 10♥ and pick up from the deck.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_17">That was lucky! You\'ve picked up another 10 from the deck. You can quickly whack it down on the pile before the next player goes.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_19">It\'s the computer\'s turn again. He could play the two 4\'s but dropping the 4, Joker and 6 is worth more points.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_21">You can only pick up the outermost cards from a straight so you can\'t pick up the Joker. The 6 looks quite useful though because then you can drop two 6\'s next go. Drop the 8 and pick up the 6.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_23">The computer will drop his highest card (the Queen) and pickup from the deck.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_25">Now drop the 6\'s and pick up from the deck.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_27">You\'ve done it! You have less than FIVE points. But first we have to wait for the other players to take their turn. The computer will drop the 5 and pick up from the deck.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_29">Now click on the Yaniv button to call Yaniv. In this case we can see the computer\'s hand but if he had the same points or fewer than you you\'d lose the round and get a 30 point penalty. So it\'s always a bit of a gamble calling Yaniv.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_31">That concludes the tutorial. A normal game continues until only one player remains. A player is out of the game once they reach 200 points. You\'ve now graduated from Yaniv school. I hope you enjoy playing the game.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_toast_2">These are your cards.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_toast_3">These are your opponent\'s cards. Normally you can\'t see what he has in his hand.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_toast_4">This is the deck where all the remaining cards are.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_toast_5">This is the discard pile where players throw down cards.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_toast_6">And this is the compass - it points to the player whose turn it is.</string>
